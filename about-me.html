<h1>About Me:</h1>
<body>
<p style="color:black;font-size:16px;"><b>Education:</b></br>
Year 12, VCE. Studied at Casey Grammar School
</p>

<p style="color:black;font-size:16px;"> I was born and raised in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. 
Both of my parents are what we would call Australian today, however my mum's parents are both Dutch. 
Since leaving school in 2011 I have worked in a wide range of jobs; Retail, Sales, Factory work and now Cabinet making. 
With working in different roles I have been able to learn and develop many skills that 
if I jumped straight into University.  
My passion from a young age has always been technology and with the crisis of COVID-19, 
being locked down for months unable to do things like go to the gym, 
or work due to my job being physical and on site I had a lot of time to think about a career change. 
Growing up I was addicted to video games and nothing has changed, 
I am still one to get my hands on each and every console that has come out to date

<p style="color:black;font-size:16px;"><b>Why University:</b></br>
Choosing to enrol into University and the variety of how many were available was overwhelming at first. 
I chose to come to RMIT as they have an online program which allows me to continue to work full time 
and still be able to study for a degree, which will help with my future when I want to change career paths.</br></br>
Through my studies at RMIT, studying a Bachelor of Information Technology 
I expect to learn the core skills required within Information Technology 
and gain in-depth knowledge of how to implement impactful technology improvements. 
This ranges from both understanding and building things like, hardware, software and even networks. 
Studying a Bachelor of Information Technology opens up a lot of pathways for my 
future with getting a career within the IT field. Prior to enrolling I have spoken with people 
who I know personally who are specialists in their respective fields that I am 
interested in going into and even though they all said “A bachelor of IT” 
isn’t necessarily a requirement but it is worth every dollar to enhance your education 
and give you the foundation of what you need to pursue a career as a Cyber Security Specialist/ 
Penetration Tester and hopefully one day become a Senior Cyber Security Specialist
