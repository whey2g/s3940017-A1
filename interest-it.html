<h1>Interest in IT:</h1>
<body>
<p style="color:black;font-size:16px;">
A few reasons I am interested in IT as a career pathway;</br>
<ul style=list-style-type:square>
<li>The job opportunities in IT are endless and career progression is always an opportunity in any of the IT fields.</li>
<li>Working in IT given its dynamic nature, keeping you on your toes, 
always adapting to changes means your job would never be boring, which 
is why I have had so many jobs over the years.</li>
<li>IT jobs pay incredibly well, and I am not one to deny the fact that money 
is a big factor on what you want to do in life, however in this instance it is just icing on the cake.</li> 
</ul>
IT has a lot to offer given it is one of the fastest growing, 
fastest changing and one of the most demanding job sectors, 
and the thought of being able to be a part of the future, make a difference is something the IT industry 
is able to give us all. In the last 100 years we have had many inventions made: 
Ballpoint pen, Colour Television, Radio tuner, Pop-up Toaster, Personal Computers, 
Video Games, Smartphones and the Internet. Everything in that list has been made within the last 100 years.</br></br>

The Internet was made in 1969, it didn’t really take off till the 2000s, 
the same thing goes with the Smartphone. Apple’s first iteration was absurdly expensive and released in 2007, 
but they didn’t gain their popularity till 2010. It is almost impossible to picture 
what life would be without these devices in our lives, we use them with almost every 
aspect of our life in the 21st century. The power of the internet has enabled global 
communities to form and This just goes to show we are in a new era of innovation and 
creation and I want to be a part of it.</br></br>

Re-wind to my childhood, I spent a lot of my time playing a lot of competitive FPS video games 
like Call of Duty: 4, Counter-Strike 1.6, Counter-Strike: Source and Combat Arms. 
Games like these, as much fun as they were, you would always be plagued with hackers, 
players who would use programs to bypass the games anti-cheat to give them an unfair advantage 
and could range from things like; wall hacks, aimbots, god mode, no clip etc… T
his is where my fascination with IT began, buying programs for a monthly subscription 
to then later being able to modify game files to make all players a static colour, 
such as friendly units bright blue and enemies red, using forums to get basic knowledge 
of how cheats work and how to make them. I soon grew out of this hacking phase 
and the more I continued to play without hacks the more I realised it was a problem, 
especially with Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.</br></br>

Cyber Security and hacking go hand in hand. 
Blue teaming (cyber security professionals responsible for main training internet network defences) 
and red teaming (offensive security professionals who are experts in attacking and breaking through cyber defences). 
When I was a kid I was only shown the red teaming side, never thought about being on the defence, 
not just protecting the users on a video game from the likes of hackers, but real hackers, 
trying to steal information, extort people for money and so on.</br></br>

In the last year with the growing popularity of podcasts a particular podcast host by the name of 
Jack Rhysider, of DarkNet diaries has inspired me to pursue a career in Cyber Security.</br>
