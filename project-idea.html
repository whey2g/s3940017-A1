<h1><b>Project Idea:</b></h1>
<body>
<p style="color:black;font-size:16px;">
EasyPi Fuel manager (placeholder name) is a RaspberryPi designed for motor vehicles 
to be the plug and play managing tool used for taxation purposes for 
fuel consumption and log book tracking. The RaspberryPi once plugged 
into a motor vehicle monitors and records fuel usage directly from the car's computer, 
records your trips easily, all without a screen, so how do I know it is working? 
We have incorporated an application with an easy to use GUI that mobile phones 
will be able to access given a pairing code to connect the RaspberryPi device to act as a controller. 
This will make the lives of anyone who uses their vehicles for personal 
and business use easily distinguish the difference between each trip and log each one, 
with the data to back up the log, which will allow for thousands saved every year on tax 
reductions for fuel consumptions. Using a subscription platform similar to Microsoft Office 
365 incorporated with tier levels for multiple users and devices, 
will also help support further development and security prevention 
methods for our cloud storage of customers data.</br></br>

I would often work with my family, assisting them with their truck business for several years, 
downloading the raw information using a laptop and then having it exported 
into an excel spreadsheet is tiring and tedious. 
I thought what if there was a way to do this without needing a laptop connected and operated, 
if the data was automatically downloaded after each trip, 
information that isn’t just stored on the SD card of the Raspberry Pi 
but also in cloud servers accessible by the owners of the EasyPi fuel account.</br></br>

Using a Raspberry Pi allows a small device to be connected at all times, 
along with a GPS tracking chip allowing for exact data extraction from both fuel 
consumption and travel distances/trips. All for a fraction of the cost of paying someone 
to create and manage  spreadsheets and log data, along with saving time not taking vehicles 
off the road to make sure the log data was downloaded etc… All of this is enticing for small business, 
sales representatives, or anyone else who uses vehicles for business and personal use. 
So many people avoid creating and managing logbooks because 
it's too hard, however as the ATO website states there is an actual hard cap on fuel 
receipts which is $3600, so a logbook is needed if 
you are exceeding that amount to receive a larger tax reduction.</br></br>

The EasyPi Fuel manager is designed much like an OBD2, but with less emphasis 
on diagnostics and error codes, and focused on data extraction of fuel consumption, 
distance travelled. Plugging the device directly into the OBD port much like when you use a laptop, 
or OBD2 you are granted root access to the vehicle's computer, 
a Raspberry Pi with automated system will download and extract the data 
from every trip whether you flag it or not and push it to our cloud repo so you have multiple 
versions accessible incase anything happens. Enabling the “Log trip” 
button to the GUI of the EasyPi fuel manager app on your mobile device means 
when it logs the trip it will highlight it as a business trip. 
This feature is especially handy when you use your vehicle for more than 
just business as it gives a clear outline of what was business and what wasn’t each week.</br></br>

<b>Skills required:</b></br> 
Programming languages:</br>
Python for Raspberry Pi</br>
Swift OS for iPhone applications</br>
JAVA for Android applications</br>
Knowledge of basic data entry, data storage advantageous for the spreadsheets</br>
Cloud security to protect users data that is stored on the cloud</br></br>

<b>Hardware Required: </b></br>
Building and developing a Raspberry Pi all comes from purchasing parts, 
putting them together using trial and error. 
Installing the choice of Raspbian OS which is a Linux based OS for the Pi.</br>
Mobile Phone (not included) but is required to operate the applications.</br></br>

<b>Tools and Technologies required:</b>
<ul style=list-style-type:square>
<li>Users will need to have a smartphone to have total control over the device with our hardware.</li
<li>Raspberry Pi core hardware to download data directly from the vehicle, included a hard shell case for protection.</li>
<li>GPS tracking chip pre-installed in the Raspberry Pi for tracking each trip's coordinates while it can be enabled.</li>
<li><a href"http://openxcplatform.com">Using an Open Source OBD2:</a>  to use as a base for our software we use to connect the Pi and the Vehicles together.</li>
<li>Mobile application suite which allows users to access the; Raspberry Pi menu, begin trips, 
monitor datasheets/logbook, admin users can access all vehicles in the fleet. 
Inbuilt Map application that for a quality of life feature 
includes a display of fuel stations available on your route.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Android">Open source map, OSMap:</a> 
to use for our base GPS navigation application</li>
</br>
If this project is successful, 
we would have successful streamlined logbooks for everyone who finds it too hard 
to do it themselves with meeting the ATOs logbook guidelines. Business owners, 
sole traders and even the everyday user won’t need to think about how to log it accurately, 
no more taking the time out of everyone's day to keep the logbook updated, 
no more worrying about about misplacing the book or accidently deleting the file as we store back in case 
anything happens to the originals.</br></br>

This guarantees success without stress when it comes to tax time for everyone to 
submit their data spreadsheets and watch the tax deductions come in.</br>
