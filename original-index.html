<p style="color:black;font-size:16px;"><b>About me:</b></br> I was born and raised in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. 
Both of my parents are what we would call Australian today, however my mum's parents are both Dutch. 
Since leaving school in 2011 I have worked in a wide range of jobs; Retail, Sales, Factory work and now Cabinet making. 
With working in different roles I have been able to learn and develop many skills that 
if I jumped straight into University.  
My passion from a young age has always been technology and with the crisis of COVID-19, 
being locked down for months unable to do things like go to the gym, 
or work due to my job being physical and on site I had a lot of time to think about a career change. 
Growing up I was addicted to video games and nothing has changed, 
I am still one to get my hands on each and every console that has come out to date
</p>
</body>
<body>
<p style="color:black;font-size:16px;"><b>Why University:</b></br>
Choosing to enrol into University and the variety of how many were available was overwhelming at first. 
I chose to come to RMIT as they have an online program which allows me to continue to work full time 
and still be able to study for a degree, which will help with my future when I want to change career paths.</br></br>
Through my studies at RMIT, studying a Bachelor of Information Technology 
I expect to learn the core skills required within Information Technology 
and gain in-depth knowledge of how to implement impactful technology improvements. 
This ranges from both understanding and building things like, hardware, software and even networks. 
Studying a Bachelor of Information Technology opens up a lot of pathways for my 
future with getting a career within the IT field. Prior to enrolling I have spoken with people 
who I know personally who are specialists in their respective fields that I am 
interested in going into and even though they all said “A bachelor of IT” 
isn’t necessarily a requirement but it is worth every dollar to enhance your education 
and give you the foundation of what you need to pursue a career as a Cyber Security Specialist/ 
Penetration Tester and hopefully one day become a Senior Cyber Security Specialist
</p>
</body>
<body>
<p style="color:black;font-size:16px;"><b>Interest in IT:</b></br> 
A few reasons I am interested in IT as a career pathway;</br>
<ul style=list-style-type:square>
<li>The job opportunities in IT are endless and career progression is always an opportunity in any of the IT fields.</li>
<li>Working in IT given its dynamic nature, keeping you on your toes, 
always adapting to changes means your job would never be boring, which 
is why I have had so many jobs over the years.</li>
<li>IT jobs pay incredibly well, and I am not one to deny the fact that money 
is a big factor on what you want to do in life, however in this instance it is just icing on the cake.</li> 
</ul>
IT has a lot to offer given it is one of the fastest growing, 
fastest changing and one of the most demanding job sectors, 
and the thought of being able to be a part of the future, make a difference is something the IT industry 
is able to give us all. In the last 100 years we have had many inventions made: 
Ballpoint pen, Colour Television, Radio tuner, Pop-up Toaster, Personal Computers, 
Video Games, Smartphones and the Internet. Everything in that list has been made within the last 100 years.</br></br>

The Internet was made in 1969, it didn’t really take off till the 2000s, 
the same thing goes with the Smartphone. Apple’s first iteration was absurdly expensive and released in 2007, 
but they didn’t gain their popularity till 2010. It is almost impossible to picture 
what life would be without these devices in our lives, we use them with almost every 
aspect of our life in the 21st century. The power of the internet has enabled global 
communities to form and This just goes to show we are in a new era of innovation and 
creation and I want to be a part of it.</br></br>

Re-wind to my childhood, I spent a lot of my time playing a lot of competitive FPS video games 
like Call of Duty: 4, Counter-Strike 1.6, Counter-Strike: Source and Combat Arms. 
Games like these, as much fun as they were, you would always be plagued with hackers, 
players who would use programs to bypass the games anti-cheat to give them an unfair advantage 
and could range from things like; wall hacks, aimbots, god mode, no clip etc… T
his is where my fascination with IT began, buying programs for a monthly subscription 
to then later being able to modify game files to make all players a static colour, 
such as friendly units bright blue and enemies red, using forums to get basic knowledge 
of how cheats work and how to make them. I soon grew out of this hacking phase 
and the more I continued to play without hacks the more I realised it was a problem, 
especially with Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.</br></br>

Cyber Security and hacking go hand in hand. 
Blue teaming (cyber security professionals responsible for main training internet network defences) 
and red teaming (offensive security professionals who are experts in attacking and breaking through cyber defences). 
When I was a kid I was only shown the red teaming side, never thought about being on the defence, 
not just protecting the users on a video game from the likes of hackers, but real hackers, 
trying to steal information, extort people for money and so on.</br></br>

In the last year with the growing popularity of podcasts a particular podcast host by the name of 
Jack Rhysider, of DarkNet diaries has inspired me to pursue a career in Cyber Security.</br>

<p style="color:black;font-size:16px;"><b>Ideal Job:</b></br>
<b>Job title:</b> Senior Cyber Security Analyst / Consultant / Specialist</br>
<b>Advertisement of Ideal Job: </b><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56106130?type=standout#sol=ef911f884a25fde6b92069edd1b6a9c15f8d6cd5">Senior Cyber Security Analyst</a></br>
<b>Snapshot of Ideal Job: </b><a href="file://‪C:\Users\Kurt\Desktop\RMIT\IIT\A1\job.pdf">Snapshot of advertisement</a></br></br>

St Vincent’s Health Australia is currently looking to recruit a Senior Cyber Security Analyst 
to join their Digital and Technology team. They have over 20,000 employees all across Australia.</br></br>

Being a Senior Cyber Security Analyst you are responsible for monitoring security access, 
conducting security assessments through vulnerability testing and risk analysis. 
Required to perform both internal and external security audits. </br></br>

The role of Senior Cyber Security Analyst is appealing to me as you are both 
a part of the blue and red team when it comes to protecting and serving the community 
or even the country. Being a part of the Cyber Security team in a hospital is a 
very big deal as you have hundreds of lives in your hands every day, 
it might not seem like it but one attack can cause great chaos, panic and doubt within a community. 
This was definitely the case throughout the pandemic in early 2020 having blackhat 
organisations attempt to steal patient information such as social security numbers in 
America or using ransomware to extort them and disable systems, 
putting patients lives at risk just for some examples. 
It doesn’t have to be for St Vincent’s Hospital but working as Cyber Security for the Government 
whether it be subcontracted or employed directly is the ideal job for me. </br></br>

<b>This role has extra benefits to me such as:</b></br>
<ul style=list-style-type:square>
<li>Access to health and wellbeing benefits including Fitness Passport.</li>
<li>Flexible working arrangements, including working from home.</li>
</br>
</b>Selection Criteria for this position include:</b></br>
7-10 IT Security or Information Security experience.</br>
Demonstrated experience with implementation of protective security systems, 
and experience in communicating these concepts with business people.</br>
(This ad doesn’t not specify education but it to get into prior roles you do 
require certificates and in most cases tertiary education is preferred)</br>
</ul></br>
<b>Additional Requirements and Skills required: </b>
In addition to the selection criteria given the ad is pretty bleak 
many others do cover what is required to obtain the position as the 
difference from Cyber Security Analyst to Senior is honestly just 
experience served but to get the job you do require a fair amount of certifications.</br>
</br>
<b>Certificates:</b>
CISSP Certified or equivalent.</br>
Ability to obtain security clearance such as NV1/NV2/PV</br>
CISM</br>
SSCP</br>
Network+/ Security+</br>
</br>
<b>Skills:</b></br>
Penetration testing</br>
Threat intelligence analysis</br>
Identity and Access management</br>
Risk and compliance auditing</br>
Network Security</br>
Mobile-remote computing</br>
</br>
One of the reasons the general job of Cyber Security is held in such high regard is 
you are also a jack of all trades and can’t just be a master in one language.</br>
The top languages include;</br>
C, C++, Java,JavaScript, SQL, PHP, PowerShell, Python</br>
</br>
Skills are more than just what we can do with a computer though, 
Cyber Security relies heavily on soft skills too, these are;</br>
Adaptability, Communication, Creativity, Leadership, Problem solving.</br></br>

I currently do not have enough understanding of any of the skills required 
to acquire an entry level position in the Cyber Security sector 
but prior to enrolling I developed a pathway on how I will get my foot in the door.</br></br>

Through enrolling in a bachelors of Information Technology I will develop the 
core skills required to then further my studies and become a master in 
the retrospective programming languages. Once I am comfortable with my 
studying I will look to get my first lot of certificates which are; Network+, 
which will help give me the understanding of the fundamentals of networks. 
From here I can move to CISCO certificates if I want to focus there. Security+ 
is next, this is the entry level certificate for security certificates plus counts 
are 1 year of prerequisites for intermediate and advanced certificates. 
Once I have these two certificates I will be job hunting for entry level positions 
in the cyber security or network security sectors, this will help me with my minimum 
requirements for my advanced and CISSP certificates. </br></br>

Once I have established a role within a company that hopefully allows for career progression 
I will be looking to obtain intermediate certifications, particularly the SSCP, 
this requires 1 year of paid work experience (Bachelors, Masters or Security+ 
all will grant this 1 year experience)</br>
Lastly I will be working for the final years to obtain a CISSP, 
this requires 5 years, (Education credits will only suffice 1 year). 
I believe this will lead me to have the most optimal pathway to obtain my ideal job.</br></br>

These test results provide a summarised report of my personality and learning styles. 
Granted these results will not change how I perceive myself. I understand how these personality 
tests are undeniably beneficial for employers. The results as such for these tests would provide 
recruiters information on how potential job candidates will impact their current employees, work 
environment and how they will operate within teams.</br></br>

Personality tests also allow us to build profiles which can be used to create 
teams going forward. The tests help build a better understanding of individuals 
and can improve how teams work together, highlighting strengths and weaknesses 
of the team. These tests at first glance allow everyone to have an overview of 
everyone's communication and learning styles, 
which can lead your team to evolve and create deeper connections.</br></br

<p style="color:black;font-size:16px;"><b>Project Idea:</b></br>
EasyPi Fuel manager (placeholder name) is a RaspberryPi designed for motor vehicles 
to be the plug and play managing tool used for taxation purposes for 
fuel consumption and log book tracking. The RaspberryPi once plugged 
into a motor vehicle monitors and records fuel usage directly from the car's computer, 
records your trips easily, all without a screen, so how do I know it is working? 
We have incorporated an application with an easy to use GUI that mobile phones 
will be able to access given a pairing code to connect the RaspberryPi device to act as a controller. 
This will make the lives of anyone who uses their vehicles for personal 
and business use easily distinguish the difference between each trip and log each one, 
with the data to back up the log, which will allow for thousands saved every year on tax 
reductions for fuel consumptions. Using a subscription platform similar to Microsoft Office 
365 incorporated with tier levels for multiple users and devices, 
will also help support further development and security prevention 
methods for our cloud storage of customers data.</br></br>

I would often work with my family, assisting them with their truck business for several years, 
downloading the raw information using a laptop and then having it exported 
into an excel spreadsheet is tiring and tedious. 
I thought what if there was a way to do this without needing a laptop connected and operated, 
if the data was automatically downloaded after each trip, 
information that isn’t just stored on the SD card of the Raspberry Pi 
but also in cloud servers accessible by the owners of the EasyPi fuel account.</br></br>

Using a Raspberry Pi allows a small device to be connected at all times, 
along with a GPS tracking chip allowing for exact data extraction from both fuel 
consumption and travel distances/trips. All for a fraction of the cost of paying someone 
to create and manage  spreadsheets and log data, along with saving time not taking vehicles 
off the road to make sure the log data was downloaded etc… All of this is enticing for small business, 
sales representatives, or anyone else who uses vehicles for business and personal use. 
So many people avoid creating and managing logbooks because 
it's too hard, however as the ATO website states there is an actual hard cap on fuel 
receipts which is $3600, so a logbook is needed if 
you are exceeding that amount to receive a larger tax reduction.</br></br>

The EasyPi Fuel manager is designed much like an OBD2, but with less emphasis 
on diagnostics and error codes, and focused on data extraction of fuel consumption, 
distance travelled. Plugging the device directly into the OBD port much like when you use a laptop, 
or OBD2 you are granted root access to the vehicle's computer, 
a Raspberry Pi with automated system will download and extract the data 
from every trip whether you flag it or not and push it to our cloud repo so you have multiple 
versions accessible incase anything happens. Enabling the “Log trip” 
button to the GUI of the EasyPi fuel manager app on your mobile device means 
when it logs the trip it will highlight it as a business trip. 
This feature is especially handy when you use your vehicle for more than 
just business as it gives a clear outline of what was business and what wasn’t each week.</br></br>

<b>Skills required:</b></br> 
Programming languages:</br>
Python for Raspberry Pi</br>
Swift OS for iPhone applications</br>
JAVA for Android applications</br>
Knowledge of basic data entry, data storage advantageous for the spreadsheets</br>
Cloud security to protect users data that is stored on the cloud</br></br>

<b>Hardware Required: </b></br>
Building and developing a Raspberry Pi all comes from purchasing parts, 
putting them together using trial and error. 
Installing the choice of Raspbian OS which is a Linux based OS for the Pi.</br>
Mobile Phone (not included) but is required to operate the applications.</br></br>

<b>Tools and Technologies required:</b>
<ul style=list-style-type:square>
<li>Users will need to have a smartphone to have total control over the device with our hardware.</li
<li>Raspberry Pi core hardware to download data directly from the vehicle, included a hard shell case for protection.</li>
<li>GPS tracking chip pre-installed in the Raspberry Pi for tracking each trip's coordinates while it can be enabled.</li>
<li><a href"http://openxcplatform.com">Using an Open Source OBD2:</a>  to use as a base for our software we use to connect the Pi and the Vehicles together.</li>
<li>Mobile application suite which allows users to access the; Raspberry Pi menu, begin trips, 
monitor datasheets/logbook, admin users can access all vehicles in the fleet. 
Inbuilt Map application that for a quality of life feature 
includes a display of fuel stations available on your route.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Android">Open source map, OSMap:</a> 
to use for our base GPS navigation application</li>
</br>
If this project is successful, 
we would have successful streamlined logbooks for everyone who finds it too hard 
to do it themselves with meeting the ATOs logbook guidelines. Business owners, 
sole traders and even the everyday user won’t need to think about how to log it accurately, 
no more taking the time out of everyone's day to keep the logbook updated, 
no more worrying about about misplacing the book or accidently deleting the file as we store back in case 
anything happens to the originals.</br></br>

This guarantees success without stress when it comes to tax time for everyone to 
submit their data spreadsheets and watch the tax deductions come in.</br>
