These test results provide a summarised report of my personality and learning styles. 
Granted these results will not change how I perceive myself. I understand how these personality 
tests are undeniably beneficial for employers. The results as such for these tests would provide 
recruiters information on how potential job candidates will impact their current employees, work 
environment and how they will operate within teams.</br></br>

Personality tests also allow us to build profiles which can be used to create 
teams going forward. The tests help build a better understanding of individuals 
and can improve how teams work together, highlighting strengths and weaknesses 
of the team. These tests at first glance allow everyone to have an overview of 
everyone's communication and learning styles, 
which can lead your team to evolve and create deeper connections.</br></br
